          Identification of relevant publications and data extraction

        <Body variant="body1" align="justify">
          The identification of relevant publications and data extraction has
          been carried out by the Singapore-based core team and the extended
          regional team, according to the area of expertise of each researcher.
          Target publications for inclusions are those that relate to any aspect
          of pollution from marine plastics in Southeast and East Asia until
          July 2021; not including publications that would relate solely to the
          production of plastic material and products or the upstream management
          of waste. The RRI 2.0 builds on the publications already captured in
          the previous version of the inventory&nbsp;
          <Link
            color="secondary"

          .
          <br />
          <br />
          In RRI 2.0, the inventory was updated to include more recent
          publications, and publications in non-English languages. The search
          for publications was limited to contents which could be found online
          (even if only the abstract). Various keywords were used in numerous
          search engines, including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and
          ProQuest (see guidance below). Domestic academic collections
          accessible to the regional team were also consulted - this enabled the
          inclusion of relevant research (such as dissertations) conducted in
          the region. Japanese-language papers could not be searched due to the
          lack of a Japanese researcher in the regional team. It is hoped that
          the regional team can be enlarged to new researchers from Japan and
          Korea in order to complete the database, make it more representative
          and improve the accessibility of the papers.
          <br />
          <br />
          RRI 2.0 includes non peer-reviewed publications provided that they
          contain primary research content and/or verifiable data presented with
          rigour so that the metadata fields could be filled reliably. In
          countries where there has been less peer-reviewed publications
          released, non-peer publications can be particularly useful
          substitutes. Furthermore, not all sampling reports lend themselves to
          a research publication whilst being fully relevant to and useful in
          the context of this database. Of note in this context, most of the
          non-English papers that could be found were peer-reviewed.

          This website is developed using two open-source libraries: React.js

          All the data is queried directly from the database inventory on Google

          accessible and usable by the website. This approach simplifies the
          development and maintenance needed and facilitates the migration of
          the dataset or the visualisation to a different platform. The website
          content is dynamic and is refreshed everyday.
